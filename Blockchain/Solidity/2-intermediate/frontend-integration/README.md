### Project Title

# The Nigeria Token

## Description

The NigeriaToken contract is a Solidity implementation of a token contract for a custom token named NG-Noken (NGN). It includes functionalities such as minting tokens, transferring tokens, and burning tokens. This contract provides the foundation for managing the NGN token on the Ethereum blockchain.

# Getting Started

### Installing

To use this contract, you need to have a Solidity development environment set up. You can install Solidity by following the official Solidity documentation at https://soliditylang.org/.

### Executing program

Once you have Solidity installed, follow the steps below to execute the contract:

1. Create a new Solidity file (e.g., `NigeriaToken.sol`) in your preferred code editor.
2. Copy and paste the provided smart contract code into the file.

3. Save the file.

To compile the contract, you can use a Solidity compiler such as Remix or the Solidity command-line compiler (`solc`). Refer to the documentation of your chosen Solidity development environment for instructions on how to compile contracts.

## Frontend Code

The provided frontend code is a React component that interacts with the NigeriaToken contract. It allows users to connect their wallets, view token information, transfer tokens, burn tokens (only available for the central bank), and mint tokens (only available for the central bank). To use the frontend code, follow these steps:

1. Set up a React development environment.

2. Copy and paste the provided frontend code into your React application.

3. Ensure that the required dependencies and custom hooks (useWalletConnection, useTokenInfo, useTransferToken, useBurnTokens, useMintTokens) are imported and available.

4. Customize the UI components and styling as desired.

5. Run your React application to access the NigeriaToken functionality through the frontend.
