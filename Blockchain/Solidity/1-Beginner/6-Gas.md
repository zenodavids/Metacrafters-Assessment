# Gas

- Gas Limit: max gas you are willing to use.
- Gas Price: How much gas you are willing to pay for one gas.
- Tx fee = gas limit \* gas price

- The higher the gas limit, the higher the computation
- lower gas you set, lower computation

- Higher gas price you set, more ether you'll spend, but your transaction will be proccessed faster
- Lower gas price you set, less ether you'll spend, and transaction will be proccessed slower

> After transaction has been added to the block, your account will be refunded for unspent gas
> Gas refunds are paid in ether

- Gas Limit: Set by you
- Block Gas limit, set by network
