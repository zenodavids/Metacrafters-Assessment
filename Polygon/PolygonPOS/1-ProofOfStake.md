# Polygon Proof of Stake Chain

This is a **_layer 2_** solution composed of **_side-chains_** that perform **_off-chain computation_** and **_consensus_** through **_Proof of Stake Validators_**.

The value proposition of the PoS chain is **_Speed_**, **_Scalability_**, and **_Security_**.

> PoS chain offers **_Scalability_** and **_Security_** while sacrificing some **_decentralization_**, and this is a choice developers and projects can make when optimizing for scalability and speed.

# Proof of Stake

This is a consensus mechanism that selects staking **_validators_** to propose and vote on the next block to be appended to the blockchain.
There are different flavors of PoS consensus, like **_chain-based_** and **_BFT (Byzantine Fault Tolerant)_**

> Note: Ethereum transitioned from a **_Proof of Work_** to **_Proof of Stake_** on **_September 15th, 2022_** during an event called the **_Merge_**.
