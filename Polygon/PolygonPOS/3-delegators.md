# Delegators

These are Matic token holders who **_delegate their stake to validators rather than participating in the validator set_**.
They receive a proportion of **_rewards that their validators make upon block production and are exposed to the risk of their validator misbehaving in the network_**.
This shared risk model incentivizes delegators to pick validators they trust, thus improving the general security posture of the network.
